In addition to `print()`, you'll get to know `input()`, another pre-defined Python function. It'll allow you to create interactive computer programs where users can enter information. Finally, you'll learn about **data type conversions** to allow you to work with **strings** and **numbers**. \n",

    "### Integers and Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably noticed above that converting 90 Fahrenheit to Celsius results in an oddly long number like `32.22222222222222`. This is a **float**. We won't go into the mathematical details here. But in Python, there is not just one data type for numbers. Instead, there are actually [three numeric data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex): **integers**, **floats**, and **complex numbers**. We will not talk about complex numbers, as they are a bit more... well... complex. But the types you'll mostly commonly interact with are integers and floats, anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are whole numbers without decimal points, while floats (floating-point numbers) include decimal points. Both represent what are called \"real\" (as opposed to \"imaginary\") numbers in mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it even matter? Why can't they all just be numbers? Well, for physical hardware reasons, some other programming languages are stricter about this. In Python, the difference isn't as strict. And if you notice from our example above, the calculation `(90 - 32) * 5/9` was made up of only integers, while the result was a float `32.22222222222222`. So Python already automatically converts the type when necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some instances when you want to make sure a calculation does not result in a float. For example, let's assume you have an app that deals with money. Whenever you make calculations, you want to make sure you don't end up with a number like `32.22222222222222`. To achieve that, a standard solution is to not use floats in the first place, and instead stick to integers. Rather than \"$32.22,\" you'd use \"3222 cents\" for your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a way of enforcing specific data types. With the built-in functions `int()` and `float()`, you can convert floats to integers or vice versa and thereby make sure the resulting number is of a specific type. \n",
