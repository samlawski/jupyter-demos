    "# 👋 Welcome To Jupyter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this quick introduction to Jupyter Notebooks. Keep reading if you want to find out **how to navigate and work with Jupyter Notebooks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤨 What is this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a Jupyter Notebook is **just a file** - like a Word document or a PDF. It's a combination of text and **interactive code** (mostly Python, but other code also works.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you need the program Microsoft Word to open a Word file or a PDF reader to open a PDF file, you need a particular program to open Jupyter Notebook files. The fact that you're reading this means that you are currently using one such program. The two main programs to work with notebooks are **JupyterLab** and **Jupyter Notebook**. Typically, they run inside a web browser. To learn more, you can check the [official website](https://jupyter.org/try).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📺 What is this interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, the interface can be a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of buttons and places to click. **Most can be ignored** for now, as you only need them once you create your own Jupyter Notebook files and work with multiple files simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program you're using to view the notebook uses **JupyterLab**, you'll see a list of files on the left. That's where you can open, create, delete, and move Jupyter Notebooks files (but also other files.) You open a file by double-clicking on it. At the top, you have the usual navigations for saving, downloading, editing, and more. The actual Notebook file takes up the most space on the screen. Most likely, you only have to worry about that space for now and can ignore the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 How to work with Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is split into multiple **cells**. A cell is usually either a bit of what's called **Markdown text** (like what you're reading right now) or a piece of **code**. You can **select cells** by clicking on them or using the arrow keys on your keyboard."

    "\n",
    "Some Jupyter Notebooks may have cells that aren't editable. For example, try entering **Edit Mode** on this cell. You will notice that you aren't able to change the text here. That's because you can configure individual cells to be **editable** or **read-only**. You do that by editing the so-called **metadata** of a cell. That's hidden data that's not visible in the editor but can be used to configure specific cells. Going into the details of that is beyond the scope of this  introduction. But I wanted to mention it here so you're not confused when you come across Jupyter Notebooks where you can't edit cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Editing metadata looks different depending on where you open a Jupyter Notebook. In a JupyterLab environment like this one, you can see two cogwheels at the top right corner of the interface. Clicking on those will reveal an interface to edit cell metadata. "
