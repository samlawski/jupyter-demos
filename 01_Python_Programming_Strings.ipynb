    "All computer software and everything you're looking at on the screen now had to be **programmed** at some point. You're using a **program** to view this course (probably a web browser like Firefox or Chrome). This program runs on an **operating system** (like Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, or Linux). The operating system (or \"OS\") is yet another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "All computers (including phones and similar devices) have a piece of hardware called a **\"processor\"**. This is the heart of every computer as it runs the software. There are, of course, a lot more parts than that. But you need to understand that programming is basically writing instructions to be executed by the physical computer processor and all its connected parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing instructions that are understandable to the processor is hard, and these instructions tend not to be very readable by humans. Look at this example of Assembly code to display the message \"Hello World!\" on a computer screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```asm\n",
    "org  0x100\n",
    "\n",
    "mov  dx, msg\n",
    "mov  ah, 9\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "That's how developers used to program (and sometimes still do). It's very hard to read. That's why, over time, many new programming languages were developed. These newer programming languages are meant to be understandable to humans. However, to make those programming languages understandable by the processor, they have to be converted back into something closer to the code above. That step is called **\"compiling\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Very broadly speaking, there are two ways to **compile** code. Either it is compiled directly on the computer of the developer or every user who wants to execute the code installs a program on their own computer that compiles the code \"on the fly,\" which is programmer speak for \"as it runs.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages like **C**, **C++**, or **Rust** are compiled by the developer. The code gets _compiled_ into an **executable** file. That means all the user has to do is open the program file and it will run on their computer. They don't need anything else. This is true for most desktop applications, games, or phone apps. You download them, click on them, and they \"just work\" (usually).\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages like **Python** or **JavaScript**, on the other hand, are usually compiled on the fly. That means when I write a Python program and give it to you, I give you a code file ending with **.py**. If you want to run that file on your computer, you have to have **Python** installed. That's the compiler that, on the fly, turns the Python code into something understandable by the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of the first category of programming languages is that you can give people an executable file (like a .exe file on Windows), and they don't have to worry about installing any additional software to run it. However, they won't be able to read or alter the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of the second group of languages is that it's easier to work together with other developers and - if you need to - make changes to the code quickly, since you can share the raw code with the person executing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more differences. But this is enough to know for now to understand how Python works and why you need to have an extra program called \"Python\" installed on your computer to run a Python code file. You can of course also practice with and run Python code in a Jupyter Notebook like this one.\n",

    "## 🐍 This is Python\n",

    "\n",
    "In this course, you'll learn **Python**. Python is very popular these days because it's very versatile. It's used extensively in data science, web development, and other domains. Compared to other programming languages, Python is also relatively easy to read and write because a lot of it looks like regular English. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, Python is compiled into something the processor can understand (see the graphic below). That's done by the software **Python** that must be installed on your computer to run Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter (that compiles the code on the fly) is also integrated into **Jupyter Notebooks**. That's why you can execute Python code from within this page."

    "Many applications need to display text. To choose a basic example, think of screens on buses or trains that display the next stop. They run some software to display the name of the next stop. They don't need to allow the user to interact with the text in any way. They only need to display the text. \n",

    "\n",
    ">💡 **Side Note:** When you start programming, you usually start by writing only text-based programs. Programs like the one you're using right now or web apps have **graphical user interfaces (GUI)**. When learning a programming language from scratch, it's common to start with text-based applications only. The first computers didn't have GUIs. And still, nowadays, it's very common to interact with many computers (e.g., web servers) through text-only interfaces. Those interfaces are also called **Terminal** or **Command Line**. Every computer has such an interface. You can find it by searching for the \"Terminal\" application on macOS and Linux. On Windows 10 and up, you can look for the \"Powershell.\"\n",
    ">Developers regularly interact with their computers through the Terminal. It's very useful for executing text-based programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you write a single line of code to output the text \"Hello World\" on the screen: \n",

    "Your first step is always to read the error message and try to understand what it's trying to tell you. **Usually, an error message contains the most crucial information at the beginning or end.** But you may also have to search a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the last code block above should throw an error that says `SyntaxError: incomplete input`. It also comes with a visualization of where the error occurred: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello again\"\n",
    "                   ^\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you tell what the error is trying to tell you? Try to fix it and rerun the code afterward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"syntax\" refers to the way the language is written, including the characters (letters or digits), punctuation, and spaces used to write code instructions - more on that below. The fact that this is a \"SyntaxErorr\" gives you the first clue about what might have gone wrong, while \"incomplete input\" tells you that a piece of code you wrote seems \"incomplete.\" Lastly, errors always tell you where in the code it occurred. In this case, the error message said `line 1` and even gave you a visual representation of where precisely in the line the error occurred. You don't always get errors as easy to work out as this one. But you should always try to use those clues to understand the error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't figure out what the error is saying, you can copy and paste parts of it into a search engine to see whether someone has had the same issue before. (That's also precisely how most professional programmers do it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll likely end up on a website like **StackOverflow** or **GitHub**. On StackOverflow, you may scroll through various answers to find one that fits. You can also search directly for your issue there. GitHub is a platform to host code projects. So, if you find solutions there, they might be bug reports or discussions on a code repository. For a beginner, this might be a bit harder to understand. However, it can be very valuable to read through the discussions of professional programmers to understand how problems are solved in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a generative AI tool or **LLM (Large Language Model)** to help during your learning process. Popular ones are [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Microsoft's Bing](https://www.bing.com/new), [GitHub's Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Mozilla's MDN AI Help](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/ai-help), and [Google's Bard](https://bard.google.com/). There are also several [free and open-source LLMs](https://chat.lmsys.org/). LLMs are particularly good at some things, but they are not always 100% accurate or reliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are particularly good at **explaining concepts in simple terms** (e.g., add \"explain like I'm five ...\" to your prompt). They are also helpful in **explaining code and identifying bugs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs do work impressively well. However, an LLM is only as good as the data it's been trained with. There is always the chance that the answers it gives are **highly biased** based on the original sample data, are made up, or are simply wrong. Remember that you can never be 100% certain of the integrity or quality of the results. Always verify AI-generated answers with multiple sources. "

    "Data can have varying types, called **data types**. `\"Hello World\"` is a **string**. `42` is a number (the specific type of number is called **integer**). This may seem obvious. But in programming, it's often important to be very explicit about what kind of data we are using. For example, you can do math with numbers but not with text. You sometimes want to search for a specific set of characters (a word) within a text string. However, you rarely need to find specific numbers (like `123`) within a larger number (like `23783012383429`). That is, you will often need to do different things with different **data types**, so it's crucial to be able to differentiate between them. \n",

    "Strings are pieces of text (that may also include numbers). Strings always start and end with double quotes `\"` or single quotes `'`. These quotes must come in pairs!

On macOS, you can just download and install Python [from the official python.org website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On Linux, you can usually install it through a package installer. Common commands to do that are `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install python3`. \n",
